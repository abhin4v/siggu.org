Dear Dr. Harari,

I am interested in the meditation research you mention in Chapter 21 of
your latest book. On page 322 (of the printing I own) you mention:

``Some universities and laboratories have indeed begun using meditation as a research
tool rather than as a mere object for brain studies. Yet this process is still in its
infancy, partly because it requires an extraordinary investment on the part of the
researchers.''

Unfortunately, this is one of the few references you make without including an
endnote. Or perhaps fortunately --- as it gives me an excuse to write you this
letter. I would love to know which universities and laboratories you refer to in this
passage precisely because I have a desire to make such an investment.
