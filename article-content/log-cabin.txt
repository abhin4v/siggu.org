## The paradox of off-grid life: there's nowhere off the grid in 2019.

- what is the "grid"?
  - electricity
  - water
  - sewage & grey water
  - "off-grid's dirty little secret is propane"
  - energy (gas, propane, wood)
  - telecommunications
  - data (electronic fingerprint, even without internet)
  - electronics (laptop to write)? plastic? metal? glass? prescription eyewear?
    medicine? lumber? textiles?
  - The Knowledge: rebuilding would start with harvesting the old refined materials
- woman in russia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agafia_Lykova
  - grid vs. off-grid is really a spectrum
  - prepping vs. off-grid vs. homesteading
- what to do with garbage / recycling
  - Rob's "steel in trucks to carry one plastic bottle" argument, why this quickly
    breaks down at scale, and why it's dangerous to allow this line of thinking into
    the global consciousness (see: Nirbheek argument)
  - diesel fuel = 90% of waste management costs in Bangalore
  - Dhamma Sineru's incinerator
  - India's Three Body Problem
- What is "sustainable"?
  - Sustainable = Longevity? (Deepa)
  - composting toilets are not sustainable and neither are mud huts (Thiruvanamalai)
    - everyone is trying to reach Level 4 (see: Factfulness)
  - sustainability demands scale
  - monastic life is the ultimate unsustainable "sustainable living"
    - Kannadiga boy who plans to be a monk with no external support
- Why is this interesting at all?
  - Ehipassiko: Come and See Yourself: How hard is it?
    - bedding: sleeping bags, beds, blankets - sleep (Why We Sleep?)
    - shelter: tents, cabin (grid lumber)
    - drinking water: carry, well + Berkey filter, better filters
    - food: grocery store, garden
      - cooking: wood, outdoor petroleum, indoor petroleum (Level 2 is not better)
      - eating: floor, chair, table... the value of level surfaces and indoor
                surfaces
      - refrigeration: none, cooler, cold storage, koolatron, proper fridge
    - toilets: dig a hole (pit toilet), composting toilet, flush toilet
    - bathing: wet wipes, rain + sponge baths, well + HWOD showers, brushing teeth
    - grey water: rocks + dirt
    - sewage: pit toilet, humanure, local treatment
    - transportation: walking, bicycles, trucks, boats
    - lighting: headlamps, candles, LEDs
    - washing clothes: don't, by-hand, washing machine (see: Factfulness)
    - reading: don't, kindle, bookshelf - requires lighting
    - warmth: clothing, wood stove, insulation, propane, gas, electric heat
    - electricity: none, generator, solar/wind
    - time: coming here during "vacation" (and leaving it unattended otherwise)
    - crime: fighting squatters, thieves, and vandals (Matthew's cabin)
  - The Knowledge: water levels rising for hundreds of years even if carbon output
    ended today = refugees in every country, the need for mobile cities, the need for
    smaller living
  - argument with Nirbheek, network effects, aggregate effects
- Factfulness and World Bank's Levels
  - Everyone is trying to reach Level 4
  - Even in a Level 4 country, Level 4 is surprisingly difficult to achieve without
    the power grid, clean water, sewage, roads... but it's very difficult to remain
    at Level 1 within a Level 4 country.
